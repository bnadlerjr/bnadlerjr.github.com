I prefer Ruby's Test::Unit over RSpec, but one of the things I like about RSpec
is the [let method](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/2-6/docs/helper-methods/let-and-let).
It allows you to create memoized helper methods in your tests.

<br />
Here's a way to do that in Test::Unit:

<%= gist 7728771 %>

Now instead of writing helper methods in your tests like this...

<%= gist 7728782 %>

You can use "let" like this...

<%= gist 7728788 %>
