<p>During iteration planning, sometimes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">user stories</a> need to be split so that they can be better handled. Here are a few ideas for doing just
that.</p>
<dl> <dt>Split according to data boundaries:</dt> <dd>Try splitting based on
the data needed to support the story, like region (i.e. northeast, southeast,
etc.), instead of everything (i.e. U.S.).</dd><dd><br /></dd> <dt>Split by
operation:</dt> <dd>Make an effort to split stories into separate CRUD
operations (i.e. create, read, update, destroy).</dd><dd><br /></dd>
<dt>Separate performance requirements:</dt> <dd>If a story is made complicated
by specific performance requirements, split the functional and non-functional
requirements into separate stories (i.e. Story 1: Make the chart screen; Story
2: Make it respond in &lt; 1 second).</dd><dd><br /></dd> <dt>Split by
Priority:</dt> <dd>If a large story has pieces that have different priorities,
split them into separate stories.</dd> </dl>
<p>For more on when and how to split stories, I highly recommend reading Mike
Cohn's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Estimating-Planning-Mike-Cohn/dp/0131479415">Agile Estimating and Planning</a>.</p>
