<p>I was playing around with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> a
few months ago and decided to create a small app with it. It's a very basic
online fuel efficiency tracker which I've dubbed with the stupid name: <a href="http://fuelyo.heroku.com/">Fuelyo</a>.</p>
<p>You send a text message to the app (I'm using <a href="http://www.zeepmobile.com/">ZeepMobile</a> for SMS support) with the
details of your fill-up. The app calculates your MPG and sends you a text back.
You can then go to the app online and see a history of your MPG ratings.</p>
<p>I've put the <a href="https://github.com/bnadlerjr/fuelyo">source code on GitHub</a>. Since this is my first real Sinatra app if anyone has any pointers
regarding the code please let me know!</p>
