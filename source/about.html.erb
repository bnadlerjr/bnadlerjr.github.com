<h1>Bob Nadler</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Bob Nadler, Jr. and I'm a software developer living
in NJ. I have over 10 years experience building business software applications,
7 of them in the financial services sector.</p>

<p>I began programming when I was 14, starting with Pascal and eventually
moving on to C. My professional experience started with extending MS Office
using VBA. Eventually I moved on to the .NET framework using C# and then Ruby.</p>

<p>I've managed teams of 3 to 5 developers and have worked in various areas of the
project lifecycle from requirements and user interface design to coding and
testing. I prefer doing some type of
<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> development.</p>

<p>Currently, I work for <a href="http://cyrusinnovation.com">Cyrus Innovation</a>
developing web applications using the
<a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a> process.
We collaborate with clients' developers to figure out how they can more
effectively deliver working software, using agile process methodologies such as
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment">Test Driven Development</a>.
The technology stack includes Ruby and Java.</p>
