This one had me "stumped" for awhile. When using
[motion-stump](https://github.com/siuying/motion-stump) mocks, you need to clear
them in an after block like this:

```ruby
after do
  Stump::Mocks.clear!
end
```

Someone has submitted a
[pull request](https://github.com/siuying/motion-stump/pull/5) to motion-stump
for this to happen automatically but it hasn't been merged yet.
