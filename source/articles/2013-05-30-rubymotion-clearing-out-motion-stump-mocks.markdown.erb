*Update: The pull request mentioned below has been merged and <code>motion-stump</code> clears mocks automatically now, so this <code>after</code> block is no longer necessary.*

This one had me "stumped" for awhile. When using [motion-stump](https://github.com/siuying/motion-stump) mocks, you need to clear them in an after block like this:

```ruby
after do
  Stump::Mocks.clear!
end
```

Someone has submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/siuying/motion-stump/pull/5) to motion-stump for this to happen automatically but it hasn't been merged yet.
