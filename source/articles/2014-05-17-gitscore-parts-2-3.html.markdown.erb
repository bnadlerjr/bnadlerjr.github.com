Here are parts 2 & 3 to the GitScore project. They are a follow-up to an [earlier post](/articles/2014/04/01/gitscore-part-1.html). I originally intended the screencast to be two parts, but I had to split up part two so that I would be under the allowed YouTube length. I've also put the example code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bnadlerjr/gitscore).
