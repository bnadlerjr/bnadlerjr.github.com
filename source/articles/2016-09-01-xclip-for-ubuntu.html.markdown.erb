Awhile back I [wrote](https://bobnadler.com/articles/2015/11/18/osx-pbcopy.html) about `pbcopy` for OS X. These days I find myself using Ubuntu quite often and missed having `pbcopy`. Turns out there is a package called [xclip](https://launchpad.net/xclip) that does the same thing on Ubuntu! Give it a try!
